# Channels

- Communicate data among goroutines
- Synchronize goroutines
- Typed
- Thread-safe

- `->` operator is used to send and recieve data with channels
- The direction of the arrow represents the data flow

```
ch <- v     // send data to channel
v <- ch     // receive data from channel
```

- Channels are blocking, which means that the sender goroutine waits for the receiver to be ready
- Similarly, the receiver goroutine is going to block until there is a corresponding sender goroutine ready to send
- Channels are responsible for making the goroutine runnable again once it has received or sent the data

`close(ch)`
Closing the channels means - There are no more values to send

Receive returns two values:

`value, ok = <- ch`

- `ok` is `true` if value is generated by write
- `ok` is `false` if value is generated by a close

---

## Range over a channel

```
for value := range ch {
    ...
}
```
- iterates over values received by the channel
- loop automatically breaks when the channel is closed
- range does not return the second boolean value

## Unbuffered Channels
- If there is no buffer between the sender goroutine and the receiver goroutine, the sender goroutine will block until
there is a receiver to receive the value.
- And the receiver goroutine will block until there is a sender goroutine ready to send the value

## Buffered Channels
- Channels are given capacity
- in-memory FIFO queue
- Asynchronous

- In buffered channels, there is a buffer between the sender goroutine and the receiver goroutine
- We can specify the capacity of the buffer
- The buffer indicates the number of values which can be sent without the receiver being ready to receive the values
- The sender can keep sending the values without blocking till the buffer becomes full
